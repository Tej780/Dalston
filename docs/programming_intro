### Easy

#### [Magic Eight Ball](./docs/magic_eight_ball.md)

In this project we'll be creating a *Magic 8 ball* using the Sense HAT. If you've never seen one
before, you might remember it from Toy Story: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOracFClBg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOracFClBg</a>. It's a very simple toy: You ask it a question, you shake the ball (or Sense HAT),
and it'll give you an answer.

#### [Draw a picture](./docs/draw_a_picture_project.md)

In this project you'll learn how to draw a picture on the Sense HAT.

#### [Making Glitter](./docs/glitter.md)

In this project you'll learn how to make the glittery pattern that came on the screen when you turned on the Raspberry Pi!

### Medium

#### [Dice](./docs/Dice.md)
In this project you will turn the Raspberry Pi into dice that will show numbers from 1 to 6 when you shake it.

#### [Paint](./docs/paint_project.md)

In this project you'll create a simple program that allows you to paint on the
screen.

#### [Marble Maze](./docs/marble_maze_project.md)

In this project you'll be creating a digital version of Marble Maze (see the
  picture if you don't know what it is).
The Sense HAT can tell whether you're tilting your device, using this feature
we can create the game. You'll also get to design your own maze in this
project.

#### [Snake](./docs/snake_project.md)

In this project, you'll recreate the classic game *Snake*.

### Hard

#### [Countdown clock](./docs/countdown_clock_project.md)

In this project you will be creating a simple countdown clock. The user should
be able to set a number from 0 to 99, and the clock will tick from that number
down to 0.

#### [Pong](./docs/pong_project.md)

In this project you'll be creating the classic game _Pong_ on the Sense HAT.
*Note: This project is very hard, so you might want to attempt an easier project
before doing this one.*



### Create your own project

Have you already done one of our projects, and now you want to try to make something of your own? You can start from this empty Trinket project here:

<a href="https://goo.gl/Ai7nR9" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/Ai7nR9</a>

You can discuss with your supervisors about how you could complete the project you want to do. Keep in mind
that you only just started to learn Python, so you shouldn't try to make something that's *too* advanced yet.
